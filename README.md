AI-Driven Jarvis Project
Overview
The AI-Driven Jarvis Project is an advanced virtual assistant designed to provide a wide range of functionalities including speech recognition, natural language processing, task automation, and face recognition. Built using Python, this project leverages multiple technologies to create an interactive and efficient assistant.

Features
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken language into text.
Natural Language Processing: Understands and processes user commands.
Task Automation: Automates routine tasks such as sending emails, setting reminders, and more.
Face Recognition: Identifies users and grants access based on recognized faces.
Real-time Responses: Provides real-time responses and interactions.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Eel: For connecting front-end with back-end.
OpenCV: For face detection and recognition.
face_recognition: For face recognition functionality.
Flask: For creating a local web server.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For front-end development.
SpeechRecognition: For handling speech recognition.
Google Dialogflow: For natural language understanding and chatbot functionalities.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
A webcam (for face recognition)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-driven-jarvis.git
cd ai-driven-jarvis
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Face Recognition:

Place the image of the known face in the project directory and name it known_face.jpg.
Running the Project
Start the Main Program:

bash
Copy code
python run.py
Access the Web Interface:

The application will open in your default web browser.
Project Structure
main.py: Main entry point of the application, initializes the Eel web interface and starts the local server.
run.py: Manages multiprocessing to run Jarvis, hotword detection, and face recognition concurrently.
engine/: Contains modules for various functionalities such as hotword detection and feature implementations.
www/: Contains the front-end files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required for the project.
Detailed Description of Key Components
Face Recognition
The face recognition component uses the face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces from the webcam feed. When a recognized face is detected, it triggers a welcome message and starts Jarvis.

Speech Recognition
Jarvis uses the SpeechRecognition library to convert spoken language into text. This text is then processed to understand user commands using natural language processing techniques.

Task Automation
Jarvis can perform a variety of automated tasks, such as:

Sending emails
Setting reminders and alarms
Searching the web
Providing weather updates
Managing your calendar
Front-End Interface
The front-end interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interaction platform where users can type commands or view responses from Jarvis.

Future Enhancements
Voice Synthesis: Implement text-to-speech for audible responses.
Multi-User Support: Enhance face recognition to support multiple users with personalized settings.
Integration with Smart Home Devices: Extend functionalities to control smart home devices.
Mobile Application: Develop a mobile application for remote interaction with Jarvis.
